2016/02/20: 02:00  setting up. test powermethod.

2016/02/21: 01:30  review on torch. did http://torch.ch/docs/five-simple-examples.html

2016/02/22: 05:00  Read the source code of cifar, mnist, cifar(92.4%) to develop my train() function. Read optim. Read oxford pratical4. Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUKp0c4xb8w. Start writing train().   

2016/02/23: 01:30  Read the source code of cifar, mnist, cifar(92.4%). Continue my train()

2016/02/24: 00:30  Read the source code of confusion matrix.  

2016/02/26: 00:15  Finished train.lua 
            00:40  Started provider.lua. Read the source code for dataloading( mnist, cifar10 )
            01:00  Developed data loading script. Investigated data format in mnist, cifar.
